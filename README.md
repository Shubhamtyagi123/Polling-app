### E-Polling system 

The concept behind our POC is an maintaining an E-Polling system for a state government or even higher authorities so that they can remove the EVMs and less mistakes happen.

The E-Polling system is divided into three different stages or sub-domains, i.e., region, city and state area. The state government will have the highret priority and can access all the data of the respective elections conducted. Similarly, the order follows by the city and the specific region. A specific stage can access the information of the lower stage only.

The cities will be registered of the specific state by the state authority only followed by the cities which will register the name of the candidates and the date and time they registered.
The polling will start on the registered voting day only .
Each citizen can vote for only one candidate from their respective city.
The data of each candidate from every city will go the state authority.
The data can only be accessed not changed by the state government.
On the end of the day the person with the maximum votes will win the election for his/her state.
